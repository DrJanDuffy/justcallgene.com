# Link Status - Google Search Console

## Current Status

**Google Search Console shows:**
- External links: Total 0
- Internal links: Total 0
- Top linked pages: No data
- Top linking sites: No data
- Top linking text: No data

## Why "No Data" is Normal

This is **expected and normal** for:
- ✅ New websites
- ✅ Recently deployed sites
- ✅ Sites with limited crawl history

**Google needs time to:**
1. Crawl all your pages
2. Discover and process all links
3. Build a complete link graph
4. Generate link reports

**Typical timeline:**
- **New site**: 1-4 weeks before link data appears
- **Established site**: Links update continuously
- **Internal links**: Usually detected faster (1-2 weeks)
- **External links**: Takes longer, depends on external sites linking to you

## Current Internal Linking Structure

Your site **does have internal links** - they're properly implemented:

### ✅ Navigation (Header)
- Main navigation menu with links to:
  - `/probate`
  - `/sellers/valuation`
  - `/communities/*` (6 community pages)
  - `/media/videos`
  - `/media/market-updates`
  - `/about`
  - `/faq`
  - `/contact`

### ✅ Footer Links
- Footer navigation with multiple link sections
- Links to important pages
- Links to `/terms`, `/privacy`, `/sitemap.xml`

### ✅ Internal Links Component
- `InternalLinks` component used on many pages
- Provides contextual internal links
- Used on: About, Contact, Services, Communities, etc.

### ✅ Breadcrumbs
- Breadcrumb navigation on pages
- Provides hierarchical linking structure

### ✅ Content Links
- Links within blog posts
- Links in service pages
- Links in community pages

### ✅ Next.js Link Component
- All links use Next.js `Link` component
- Proper `href` attributes
- SEO-friendly internal linking

## Why Links May Not Show Yet

### 1. **Crawl Frequency**
- Google crawls new sites less frequently
- Takes time to discover all pages
- May need multiple crawls to build link graph

### 2. **Page Discovery**
- Google needs to discover pages before analyzing links
- Sitemap submission helps
- Initial crawl focuses on main pages

### 3. **Link Analysis Delay**
- Google processes link data after crawling
- Link reports update periodically (not real-time)
- May take weeks to appear in Search Console

### 4. **Indexing Priority**
- Google prioritizes content indexing
- Link analysis happens after content indexing
- Internal links usually appear before external

## What You Can Do

### 1. ✅ Submit Sitemap (Already Recommended)
- Submit: `https://www.justcallgene.com/sitemap.xml`

### 4. ✅ Improve Internal Linking (Already Good)

## Expected Timeline

### Internal Links:

### External Links:
- **Varies**: Depends on when others link to you

- **Manual**: Can be accelerated with link building
