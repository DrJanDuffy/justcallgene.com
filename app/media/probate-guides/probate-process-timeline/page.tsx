              Phase 1: Initial Probate Filing and Court Appointment (Weeks 1-4)
            </h2>

            <p>
              The probate process begins with filing probate documents with the California probate court and obtaining court appointment of an executor or administrator. This initial phase establishes legal authority to handle probate property sales.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-8 mb-4">
              Filing Probate Petition
            </h3>

            <p>
              The probate process starts with filing a probate petition with the appropriate California probate court. This petition requests court appointment of an executor (if there's a will) or administrator (if there's no will) to manage the estate, including probate property sales. The filing typically occurs within 30 days of death, though timelines can vary based on circumstances.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-8 mb-4">
              Court Appointment and Letters
            </h3>

            <p>
              After filing, the court reviews the petition and issues Letters Testamentary (for executors) or Letters of Administration (for administrators). These letters provide legal authority to handle probate property sales, sign contracts, and manage estate affairs. Court appointment typically occurs within 2-4 weeks of filing, depending on court schedules.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-12 mb-6">
              Phase 2: Property Inventory and Valuation (Weeks 4-12)
            </h2>

            <p>
              Once court appointment is obtained, the executor or administrator must inventory probate properties and obtain professional valuations that meet court requirements. This phase is essential for establishing probate property values and preparing for probate property sales.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-8 mb-4">
              Property Inventory
            </h3>

            <p>
              The executor or administrator must create a complete inventory of all probate properties, including real estate in Orange County communities. This inventory must be filed with the court and includes property descriptions, addresses, and estimated values. Our probate real estate specialists assist with property inventory, ensuring accurate documentation for court requirements.
            </p>

Our probate real estate specialists provide comprehensive property valuations that meet court requirements while maximizing estate values.

            </h2>

            <p>
              After property valuation, probate properties must be prepared for sale and marketed to qualified buyers. This phase involves property preparation, marketing strategy development, and buyer outreach to ensure successful probate property sales.

Our probate real estate specialists coordinate property preparation, ensuring probate properties are positioned optimally for successful sales in Orange County markets.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-8 mb-4">

              Phase 4: Offer Receipt and Court Confirmation (Weeks 20-32)
            </h2>

            <p>
              When offers are received for probate properties, they must be presented to the court for confirmation. This phase involves offer review, court filing, and court confirmation hearings to approve probate property sales.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-8 mb-4">

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-8 mb-4">
              Court Confirmation Hearing
            </h3>

            <p>
              California probate courts require confirmation hearings to approve probate property sales. These hearings allow the court to review sale terms, ensure proper procedures were followed, and approve probate property sales. Court confirmation typically occurs 30-60 days after offer acceptance, depending on court schedules.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-12 mb-6">

            </h2>

            <p>
              After court confirmation, probate property sales proceed to closing, with proceeds distributed according to court orders and estate plans. This final phase completes probate property sales and distributes estate proceeds to beneficiaries.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-8 mb-4">
              Property Closing
            </h3>

            </h3>

            <p>
