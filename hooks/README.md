# Custom React Hooks

This folder contains reusable React hooks for the application.

## Usage

import { useForm } from '@/hooks/useForm';
import { useMobile } from '@/hooks/useMobile';
```

## Guidelines

- One hook per file
- Export hooks as named exports
- Include JSDoc comments
- Add TypeScript types for all parameters and return values
